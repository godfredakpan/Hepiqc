                              Arthritis is very common but is not well understood. Actually, “arthritis”
                              is not a single disease; it is an informal way of referring to joint pain
                              or joint disease. There are more than 100 different
                              <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/">
                                  types of arthritis
                              </a>
                              and related conditions. People of all ages, sexes and races can and do have
                              arthritis. It is most common among women and occurs more frequently as
                              people get older.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              Common arthritis joint symptoms include swelling, pain, stiffness and
                              decreased range of motion. Symptoms may come and go. They can be mild,
                              moderate or severe. They may stay about the same for years, but may
                              progress or get worse over time. Severe arthritis can result in chronic
                              pain, inability to do daily activities and make it difficult to walk or
                              climb stairs. Arthritis can cause permanent joint changes. These changes
                              may be visible, such as knobby finger joints, but often the damage can only
                              be seen on X-ray. Some types of arthritis also affect the heart, eyes,
                              lungs, kidneys and skin as well as the joints.

                              Degenerative Arthritis

                          <p>
                              Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. When the cartilage –
                              the slick, cushioning surface on the ends of bones – wears away, bone rubs
                              against bone, causing pain, swelling and stiffness. Over time, joints can
                              lose strength and pain may become chronic. Risk factors include excess
                              weight, family history, age and previous injury (an anterior cruciate
                              ligament, or ACL, tear, for example).

                              A healthy immune system is protective. It generates internal inflammation
                              to get rid of infection and prevent disease. But the immune system can go
                              awry, mistakenly attacking the joints with uncontrolled inflammation,
                              potentially causing joint erosion and may damage internal organs, eyes and
                              other parts of the body. Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis are
                              examples of inflammatory arthritis. Researchers believe that a combination
                              of genetics and environmental factors can trigger autoimmunity. Smoking is
                              an example of an environmental risk factor that can trigger rheumatoid

                              aggressive treatment is critical. Slowing disease activity can help
                              minimize or even prevent permanent joint damage. Remission is the goal and
                              may be achieved through the use of one or more medications known as
                              disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The goal of treatment is to
                              reduce pain, improve function, and prevent further joint damage.

                              Uric acid is formed as the body breaks down purines, a substance found in
                              human cells and in many foods. Some people have high levels of uric acid
                              because they naturally produce more than is needed or the body can’t get
                              rid of the uric acid quickly enough. In some people the uric acid builds up
                              and forms needle-like crystals in the joint, resulting in sudden spikes of
                              extreme joint pain, or a gout attack. Gout can come and go in episodes or,
                              if uric acid levels aren’t reduced, it can become chronic, causing ongoing

                              Arthritis diagnosis often begins with a primary care physician, who
                              performs a physical exam and may do blood tests and imaging scans to help
                              determine the type of arthritis. An arthritis specialist, or
                              rheumatologist, should be involved if the diagnosis is uncertain or if the
                              arthritis may be inflammatory. Rheumatologists typically manage ongoing
                              treatment for inflammatory arthritis, gout and other complicated cases.
                              Orthopaedic surgeons do joint surgery, including joint replacements. When
                              the arthritis affects other body systems or parts, other specialists, such
                              as ophthalmologists, dermatologists or dentists, may also be included in
                              the health care team.

                              Diabetes mellitus is a disease that prevents your body from properly using
                              the energy from the food you eat. Diabetes occurs in one of the following
                              situations:
                          </p>

                                      The pancreas (an organ behind your stomach) produces little insulin
                                      or no insulin at all. (Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone,
                                      produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, which helps the body
                                      use sugar for energy.)

                                      The pancreas makes insulin, but the insulin made does not work as
                                      it should. This condition is called insulin resistance.
                                  </p>

                              To better understand diabetes, it helps to know more about how the body
                              uses food for energy (a process called metabolism). Your body is made up of
                              millions of cells.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              To make energy, the cells need food in a very simple form. When you eat or
                              drink, much of your food is broken down into a simple sugar called glucose.
                              Glucose provides the energy your body needs for daily activities.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              The blood vessels and blood are the highways that transport sugar from
                              where it is either taken in (the stomach) or manufactured (in the liver) to
                              the cells where it is used (muscles) or where it is stored (fat). Sugar
                              cannot go into the cells by itself. The pancreas releases insulin into the
                              blood, which serves as the helper, or the "key," that lets sugar into the
                              cells for use as energy.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              When sugar leaves the bloodstream and enters the cells, the blood sugar
                              level is lowered. Without insulin, or the "key," sugar cannot get into the
                              body's cells for use as energy. This causes sugar to rise. Too much sugar
                              in the blood is called "hyperglycemia" (high blood sugar) or diabetes.

                          <p>
                          There are two main types of diabetes: <strong>Type 1</strong> and    <strong>Type 2</strong>:

                                      Type 1 diabetes occurs because the insulin-producing cells of the
                                      pancreas (beta cells) are damaged. In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas
                                      makes little or no insulin, so sugar cannot get into the body's
                                      cells for use as energy. People with Type 1 diabetes must use
                                      insulin injections to control their blood glucose. Type 1 is the
                                      most common form of diabetes in people who are under age 30, but it
                                      can occur at any age. Ten percent of people with diabetes are
                                      diagnosed with Type 1.

                                      In Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas makes insulin, but it either
                                      doesn't produce enough, or the insulin does not work properly. Nine
                                      out of 10 people with diabetes have Type 2. This type occurs most
                                      often in people who are over 40 years old and overweight. Type 2
                                      diabetes may sometimes be controlled with a combination of diet,
                                      weight management, and exercise. However, treatment also may
                                      include oral glucose-lowering medications (taken by mouth) or
                                      insulin injections (shots).

                          <p>
                              Gestational diabetes occurs when there is a high blood glucose level during
                              pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, the developing baby has a greater need
                              for glucose. Hormone changes during pregnancy also affect the action of
                              insulin, which brings about high blood glucose levels.

                              lot of sugar can lead to tooth decay, but it does not cause diabetes.

                          <p>
                              Diabetes is diagnosed with fasting sugar blood tests or with A1c blood
                              tests, also known as glycated hemoglobin tests. A fasting blood sugar test
                              is performed after you have had nothing to eat or drink for at least eight
                              hours. Normal fasting blood sugar is less than 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l). You
                              do not have to be fasting for an A1c blood test. Diabetes is diagnosed by
                              one of the following (see chart):

                              What are insulin pumps?
                          </h3>
                          <p>
                              Insulin pumps are small, computerized devices, about the size of a beeper
                              that you wear on your belt or put in your pocket. They have a small
                              flexible tube with a fine needle on the end. The needle is inserted under
                              the skin of your abdomen and taped in place. The pump releases a carefully
                              measured, steady flow of insulin into the tissue. Insulin pumps can cost
                              $6,000 to $10,000 for the pump, with additional costs for necessary
                              supplies to use the pump.Using a pump means you will have to monitor your
                              blood sugar level at least four times a day. You program doses and make
                              adjustments to your insulin, depending on your food intake and exercise
                              program. Some health care providers prefer the insulin pump over injections
                              because its slow release of insulin imitates a working pancreas.

                              Can I take both pills and insulin to control my blood sugar?
                          </h3>
                          <p>
                              Yes. The combination of insulin and an oral medication, when taken as
                              directed by your doctor, is very safe and effective in controlling blood
                              sugar. A typical combination therapy consists of taking an oral medication
                              during the day and insulin at night. Once you begin taking insulin, you
                              will need to monitor your blood sugar more often to reduce the risk of low
                              blood sugar reactions.Combination therapies are often helpful for people
                              who have Type 2 diabetes (adult onset diabetes). If you have been taking an
                              oral medication, your doctor may change your treatment plan to include
                              insulin injections. This change is often made to help people with Type 2
                              diabetes gain better control of their blood sugar.

                                      is the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries caused by
                                      atherosclerosis.

                                      (sometimes called "hardening" or "clogging" of the arteries) is the
                                      buildup of cholesterol and fatty deposits (called plaque) on the
                                      inner walls of the arteries that restricts blood flow to the heart.

                                      Without adequate blood, the heart becomes starved of oxygen and the
                                      vital nutrients it needs to work properly. This can cause chest
                                      pain called angina. When one or more of the coronary arteries are
                                      completely blocked, a heart attack (injury to the heart muscle) may
                                      occur.

                                      A network of blood vessels known as coronary arteries surround the

                          </h3>
                          <p>When fat builds up inside your arteries it causes slight injury to your blood vessel walls. In an attempt to heal the blood vessel walls, the cells release chemicals that make the blood vessel walls stnickier. Other substances traveling through your blood stream, such as inflammatory cells, cellular waste products, proteins and calcium, begin to stick to the vessel walls. The fat and other substances combine to form a material called plaque.</p>

                          </p>
                          <p>Over time, the inside of the arteries develop plaques of different sizes. Many of the plaque deposits are soft on the inside with a hard fibrous "cap" covering the outside. If the hard surface cracks or tears, the soft, fatty inside is exposed. Platelets (disc-shaped particles in the blood that aid clotting) come to the area, and blood clots form around the plaque.</p>

                          </p>
                          <p>If a blood clot totally blocks the blood supply to the heart muscle, called a coronary thrombus or coronary occlusion, the heart muscle becomes "starved" for oxygen and nutrients (called ischemia) in the region below the blockage. Within a short time, an acute coronary syndrome can occur.</p>

                          <p><strong>Acute Coronary Syndrome</strong> is a name given to three types of coronary artery disease that are associated with sudden rupture of plaque inside the coronary artery: unstable angina, Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction or heart attack (NSTEMI), or ST segment elevation myocardial infarction or heart attack (STEMI).</p>

                            Each coronary artery supplies blood to a region of the heart muscle. If an artery is occluded (blocked) there is no blood supply to that region.<br>
                            The amount of damage to the heart muscle depends on the size of the area supplied by the blocked artery and the time between injury and treatment.

                              A heart attack can also occur less frequently by a spasm of a coronary
                              artery. During coronary spasm, the coronary arteries constrict or spasm on
                              and off, causing lack of blood supply to the heart muscle (ischemia). It
                              may occur at rest and can even occur in people without significant coronary
                              artery disease. If coronary artery spasm occurs for a long period of time,
                              a heart attack can occur.

                              Some people have a heart attack without having any symptoms (a "silent"
                              myocardial infarction). A silent MI can occur among all patients, though it
                              is more common among women or people with diabetes. A silent MI may be
                              diagnosed during a routine doctor's exam.

                              what you are doing and rest. Take one nitroglycerin tablet and let it
                              dissolve under your tongue, or if using the spray form, spray it under your
                              tongue. Wait 5 minutes. If you still have angina after 5 minutes, call 911
                              to get emergency help.

                              If you experience angina, take one nitroglycerin (NTG) tablet and let it
                              dissolve under your tongue. If chest discomfort or pain is not improved or
                              getting worse 5 min after one dose, call 9-1-1 immediately to get emergency
                              help before taking additional NTG. If symptoms are much improved by 1 dose
                              of NTG, you may repeat the dose every 5 min for up to 3 tablets over 15
                              minutes. If you still have angina after taking 3 doses of nitroglycerin,
                              call 911 to get emergency help.

                              After calling 911, emergency personnel may tell you to chew one full (325
                              mg) aspirin slowly, if you do not have a history of aspirin allergy or
                              bleeding. Aspirin is especially effective if taken within 30 minutes after
                              the start of symptoms. Do NOT take an aspirin for symptoms of stroke.
                              Continue to take your nitroglycerin as prescribed.

                              At the first signs of a heart attack, call for emergency treatment (911).
                              Do not wait for your symptoms to "go away." Early recognition and treatment
                              of heart attack symptoms can reduce the risk of heart damage and allow
                              treatment to be started immediately. Even if you're not sure your symptoms
                              are those of a heart attack, you should still be evaluated.

                              The best time to treat a heart attack is within one hour of the onset of
                              the first symptoms. When a heart attack occurs, there's a limited amount of
                              time before significant and long-lasting damage occurs to the heart muscle.
                              If a large area of the heart is injured during the heart attack, full
                              recovery becomes much more difficult.

                              delay, or wait to seek treatment, for longer than seven hours.

                              When you call, emergency personnel may tell you to chew an aspirin to break
                              up a possible blood clot, if there is not a medical reason for you to avoid
                              aspirin. When emergency help arrives, they can promptly begin treatment,
                              and they are trained to revive someone whose heart has stopped. Also,
                              you're likelier to get treated faster at the hospital if you arrive by
                              ambulance. If you are having symptoms, do not drive yourself unless there
                              is absolutely no other option.

                              Treatments such as medications, open heart surgery and interventional
                              procedures DO NOT cure coronary artery disease, so it is still important to

                              Blood may be drawn to measure levels of biochemical markers. These markers
                              are found inside your body's cells and are needed for their function. When
                              your heart muscle cells are injured, their contents --including the markers
                              -- are released into your bloodstream. By measuring the levels of these
                              markers, the doctor can determine the size of the heart attack and
                              approximately when the heart attack started. Other blood testsmay also be
                              performed.

                              Echo can be used during and after a heart attack to learn about how the
                              heart is pumping and identify what areas of the heart are not pumping
                              normally. The echo is also valuable to see if any structures of the heart
                              (valves, septum, etc.) have been injured during the heart attack.

                              The knowledge gained in the past years regarding acute coronary syndromes
                              and what happens in the artery during a heart attack has helped guide
                              medical treatment. The goals of medication therapy are to break up or
                              prevent blood clots, prevent platelets from gathering and sticking to the
                              plaque, stabilize the plaque, and prevent further ischemia. These
                              medications must be given as soon as possible (within 30 minutes from the
                              start of heart attack symptoms) to decrease the amount of damage to the
                              heart muscle. The longer the delay in starting these drugs, the more damage
                              that occurs and the less benefit they can provide.

                              Blood pressure is the measurement of the pressure or force of blood pushing
                              against blood vessel walls. In hypertension (high blood pressure), the
                              pressure against the blood vessel walls is consistently too high. High
                              blood pressure is often called the “silent killer” because you may not be
                              aware that anything is wrong, but the damage is occurring within your body.

                              The only way to know if you have high blood pressure is to have your blood
                              pressure taken. It is best to know your numbers and make the changes that
                              can help prevent or limit damage.

                              measures the pressure on the blood vessel walls when your heart beats. The
                              second number is the diastolic, which measures the pressure on your blood
                              vessels between beats when the heart is at rest.

                              against blood vessel walls. In hypertension (high blood pressure), the
                              pressure against the blood vessel walls is consistently too high. High
                              blood pressure is often called the “silent killer” because you may not be

                              The most effective means of detecting prostate cancer early is through a
                              screening, which involves a digital rectal exam and measuring the amount of
                              prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. In a digital rectal exam, the
                              doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the anus in order to feel
                              the shape and size of the prostate.

                              The PSA test is believed to find most prostate cancers. PSA is a protein
                              that the prostate secretes into the bloodstream. If a man has higher levels
                              of this antigen, it may mean he has prostate cancer.

                              Fortunately, most prostate cancers have not spread at the time they are

                              “Gleason Score.” The Gleason Score is a sum of the grades of the two most

                              cancer, a new rise in the PSA level may mean that the tumor has come back.
                              Additional tests would then be needed to learn why the PSA level has

                                      . The greatest risk factor for prostate cancer is age. More than 75
                                      percent of all prostate cancers are diagnosed in men older than 65.

                                      Society. Therefore, screening for prostate cancer should be started
                                      at age 40 in men with a family history of the disease.

                                      To date, two genes have been identified that can lead to prostate

                              This fluid normally helps to nourish the eye, and flows in and out of the
                              eye through a mesh-like channel. In people with high eye pressure, the
                              fluid does not drain properly and pressure builds up in the eye.

                          <p>
                              However, it is possible to develop glaucoma even if your eye pressure is
                              normal. Currently, treatment for glaucoma is aimed at lowering your eye
                              pressure, even if it is “normal.”

                              Glaucoma treatment cannot restore vision that is lost. But treatment can
                              reduce the likelihood of additional

                          <p>
                              There are 2 main types of glaucoma found in adults:
                          </p>
                          <ul>

                                      Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type. It is found in
                                      approximately 90% of glaucoma patients in the United States. In
                                      open-angle glaucoma, the structures in the eye appear to be normal,
                                      but fluid does not drain properly, probably because of changes in
                                      and along the drainage passage. This type of glaucoma has no early
                                      warning signs and can go unnoticed for years.

                                      Chronic or acute angle-closure glaucoma accounts for about 10% of
                                      glaucoma cases in U.S. Here, the normal drainage passage in the eye
                                      is narrowed and then becomes blocked.

                              If either type of glaucoma is diagnosed early enough, a simple laser
                              treatment can be used to improve the drainage.

                              The goal of glaucoma treatment is to prevent further vision loss by
                              controlling pressure in the eye – like controlling blood pressure to
                              prevent a stroke. There are several ways in which glaucoma can be treated
                              successfully:

                                      Medications, in the form of eye drops or pills, lower pressure by
                                      reducing the amount of fluid produced in the eye, and by increasing
                                      drainage. One or more medicines may be used at the same time.

                                      Laser therapy, performed on an outpatient basis, is used to reduce
                                      pressure in the eye. A procedure called laser trabeculoplasty
                                      improves fluid drainage in patients with open-angle glaucoma.
                                      People with closed-angle glaucoma usually must be treated with a
                                      procedure called laser iridotomy, which creates a tiny opening in
                                      the iris (colored part of the eye), allowing the drainage angle to
                                      open.

                                      Surgery may be needed to create a second drainage channel in the

                                      For more advanced cases, an artificial glaucoma drainage implant
                                      may help to decrease pressure. The implant helps to drain excess
                                      fluid, which is then absorbed into the body.

                              is a clouding of the lens of the eye that prevents light from entering.
                              Since many people develop cataracts as they age, many people with glaucoma
                              also have them. The 2 problems can be treated in many patients using a
                              single combined procedure. Vision is restored more quickly, and further
                              surgery usually is not needed.

                          <p>
                              Unfortunately, no. Treatment cannot bring back vision that has been lost as
                              a result of glaucoma. But treatment can reduce the chance of further vision
                              loss. See your ophthalmologist for regular eye examinations and glaucoma
                              screenings.
